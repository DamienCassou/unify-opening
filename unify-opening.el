;;; Commentary:
;; Make everything use the same mechanism to open files. Currently,
;; `dired` has its mechanism, `org-mode` uses something different (the
;; `org-file-apps` variable), and `mu4e` something else (a simple
;; prompt). This package makes sure that each package uses the
;; mechanism of `dired`. I advise you to install the
;; [`runner`](https://github.com/thamer/runner) package to improve the
;; `dired` mechanism.

;;; Code:

;; Avoid warnings about undefined variables and functions
